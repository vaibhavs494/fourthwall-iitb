It is the event in which every club comes together on one platform to showcase the freshie junta of IIT Bombay their respective genres. Hence, there is a healthy competition by each club to make the freshies stand up on their toes through their showcase. This competition goes beyond the normal performances, speeches and videos presented by each club to more intense gaali fight (slang exchange), shouting, clapping and cheering for freshie hostels. It was the same this year also, only instead of "H10 humara hai" or "H3 ki maa ka ***", it was "H15C humara hai" and "H15B ki something something". But what did not change was the effort put up by every club to lure the freshers into their respective clubs. We saw great performances by all performing and non performing genres, and our dramatics club FourthWall also performed outstandingly and left the crowd cheering the loudest for us :-). The performance started with the famous ''Sonu ka Gold Medal'', the entertaining spoof on present JEE system and mockery of the whole two years of family pressure experienced by the JEE aspirants. The crowd was very energetic and responded like crazy having gone through the entire procedure very recently. It was followed by the famous trio Badri, Ayush, and Aditya''s stand up performance on what to actually expect after coming to IIT Bombay (pun intended :-p). Freshies burst into laughter and the response of the crowd was like madness. It sure was a hell of an entertainment for freshies and kind of a peep in for what they are about to experience in the coming days in IIT Bombay. Later the FourthWall council introduced themselves and informed the crowd about the level of professionalism the institute had attained in all these years in dramatics.

But the actress with her charm and beauty convinces yamraj to hire her as his secretary in the heaven. As the play advances we come to know that the Yamraj is very "kamchhor"  "rishwatkhor" and has an affair with her "supposedly" secretary, consequently a case is filed against him . Next is the courtroom scene where the case advances, the defence lawyer is the actress and against him is Indra (Suyash), and the judges are Goddess (Ashima) and Bramha (Rohit). The witnesses are Surya ( Abhiram) and Blue(Varun). Although the charges against Yamraj are really strong but the Actress with her wittiness turns the coin in his favour. But the intern which Yamraj hired earlier (Dabaade)again flips the coin and the ball comes in yamraj''s court again. But in the end Yamraj manages to disprove everything against him with a mixture of senti and clever speech. The best thing about the play was that this was a concept never thought before by any Sophie. It was a really very well scripted play with but a few mistakes in execution. The small (but very well acted) elements in the play made it quite hilarious. The characters were well outlined and well acted, flirty nature of actress and the charm that she creates over others adds to the humour, the peculiar style of goddess quoting everything as "middle class". The IIT "fatte" as usual are a big source of entertainment as well. There were some parts where some actors were blank and some in which some really overacted. But overall kudos to the script writer and director of the play Namrata for such an amusing script and play.\r\n</p><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size="4"><b><i><ins>The Last Verdict</ins></i></b></font>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>Scriptwriter -</b> <ul><li>Rahul Singh</li></ul></li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Mentors -</b>  <ul><li>Balashish Dubey</li>\r\n <li>Akhil Sharma (Kaanda)</li>\r\n <li>Chaitanya J.

I really enjoyed it and will always miss it. My mentors and the team mates appreciated my idea when I told them about the genre and theme of the script. I initially prepared a draft, a story which was to be portrayed on the LT stage. I shared the story with my mentors and they pointed out the mistakes in order to eradicate them and also gave some suggestions regarding adding elements in the story. Then I started writing dialogues along with the screen play. However I totally sucked in the screen play part. Kanda (one of my mentors) told me to just focus on the dialogues the screen play part we all will handle later. When the script was finally ready with dialogues the team started practicing on it. We all initially were pathetic when it came to the acting but we never gave up. We kept practicing overnight, worked for the initial screening which held before the sophie prod in order to check the current status of all the plays. Fortunately we pulled it off. Next, when there were only 2 days left before the final screening we modified the script a little bit with the help of Bala and Dhande to make the play more interesting according to the audience point of view. That was the time when Bala and Dhande came up with the idea of using mime to enact a particular scene. Then finally on the day of sophie prod we did only 2-3 run-throughs just before our final performance. I am glad that my team did a great job on the final performance though there were some fumbles but we have no regrets whatsoever. We had a lot of fun on the stage and offstage. I will always cherish those moments. Thanks and kudos to all my team mates: kartik, prateek, keshav, rahee, neha, diksha & abhjijeet. Special thanks to the mentors: kanda, bala, kapish & dhande."\r\n</p><p>\r\n<b><i>Review by Gaganjeet Singh -</i></b>\r\n<br>\r\nBased on a fight over a controversial case, this play had a very nice content. Informations to be given were nicely spread/scripted over the whole plot. Play had 2 lawyers against each other on a suicide which was very smartly framed. The story is quite simple though. A rich girl is kidnapped by some unknown kidnappers who later on force her father to commit suicide if he wants his daughter to be safe. Poor father without thinking or consulting someone else simply commits suicide (which was bit surprising for me). And there is a charge of murder on his business partner for kidnapping his daughter and forcing him to suicide because of company shares. Later on, it eventually comes that his daughter kidnapped herself with the help of her father''s business partner. And due to the lack of facts his business partner is set free by court. Charm of the play was the plot of the court-room. It was very nicely scripted and arguments from both the parts were quite strong. Having Bala on lights means you need not worry about it any more. Lights were good. Play used some nice and interesting background scores. Death and after death scenes were symbolically depicted by the evil of life, which was unique. All the actors were good. One of the lawyers'' kept fumbling with his lines, though carried out decently at the end. Play had a heavy prod. which was creating problems for the light set-up. The office of the father was made in the right quadrant of the stage to avoid unnecessary black outs. The play got nice appreciation from the audience. Overall a nice play to watch and good entertainment for the audience.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<font size="4"><i><b><ins>Lene tujhe o Gauri</ins></i></b></font>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>Scriptwriter -</b> <ul><li>Kanad Dagaonkar</li> <li>Harshveer Jain</li>\r\n</ul></li>\r\n<li><b>Mentors -</b> <ul><li>Aditya Gupta (Bonda)</li> <li>Bhavna Gupta</li></ul></li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Actors -</b> <ul><li>Kanad Dagaonkar</li> <li>Shantanu Dingre</li> <li>Aishwarya Ghumre</li> <li>Gaurav Mani Prasad</li> <li>Samarpan Soni</li> <li>Harshveer Jain</li></ul></li></ul>\r\n\r\n<p><b><i>Harshaveer speaks</i></b>,\r\n<br>\r\n"Thankyou.\r\n<br>\r\nThat is all i can say to the people i worked with during my sophie prod. Nothing else sums up the gratitude, appreciation, respect and goodwill i feel for my team and specially, our mentor. Its true - when you work with people day in and night out, you develop a sense of belonging like nothing else. You develop a sense of a family, a close knit group of hearts and minds who know each other, understand each other and above all, live some of the most precious moments of life with each other that make you look back and say - i miss you. And that happened to me within a short span of a week, in which we developed a script, practiced the scenes, decided on dialogues and finally staged a play. After that, it doesn''t matter, as it never should, whether your play was accepted or not. All that matters is what you learn, what you feel when you step down from the stage and see the faces of the people you work with and in them you see the joy you feel reflected, the happiness that engulfs you reflected, the emotions you cannot depict, reflected. And that is when you realize that your play was the best play there was, because you worked with the best team there could have been. You feel a sense of possession and love for your play, the play you scripted, acted in, directed and set up on stage. It is a feeling you can only feel once you perform and sit back and ponder over the hours you spent working on your play. And for that, i thankyou, again, Aditya ''bonda'' Gupta, Aishwarya Ghumre, Bhavna Gupta, Gaurav Mani, Kanad Dagaonkar, Samarpan Soni, Shantanu ''bhopali'' Dingre and ofcourse Karunesh Jigyasu who put me in this."\r\n</p><p>\r\n<b><i>Review by Kanhaiya Bairwa -</i></b>\r\n<br>\r\nAn awesome romantic-comedy play mentored by Aditya Bonda Gupta.

Harshveer ki funny poem se introduce hua play, taaliyo ke saath audience ko shuru se hi apni or kheench baitha tha. Manager Chadda  (samarpan soni) aur  Gauri (Aishwaryaa) ke stage par aane se Neta Chandan pandey(shantanu dingre)  ki prem kahani ki shuruaat hoti hai. aur prem-kahaani ke shuru hone se pahle usme Raj (Kanad) ki entry se kahani me ek naya mod aa jaata hai. Raj ne apna filmy character itna bakhoobi ada kiya ki aap khud ko muskurane se rok nahi sakte. aur beech beech me background music aur un par Raj nd Gauri ka act kisi film ke scene se kam nahi tha.  Shambhoo (Mani, not money :P) ke beech beech me interruptions aur dialogue delivery ne bhi khoob taaliya batori. Harshveer ek baar fir baba ke role me Neta aur Raj ko fundae dete huye  kahani ko sambhalte huye stage par aate hai.  Gauri ke ek thhappad ne poore LT ko 5 sec ke liye bilkul khamosh sa kar diya. aur freshies side character me apna talent dikhate huye apne role play kiye.\r\n<br>\r\nPlay shuru se end tak apni ko audience se jod ke rakha. costumes se lekar dialogues, har ek element apni jagah sahi tha. har scene ke baad story apne alag andaaj me aage badhi. iska poora credit mentors ko jaata hai. in short, sophomores ki taraf se ek behtareen play tha.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<font size="4"><b><i><ins>Meethe Kenchue\r\n</ins></i></b></font>\r\n<ul><li>\r\n<b>Scriptwriter -</b> <ul><li>Karunesh Jigyasu</li> <li>Shrey Singh</li></ul></li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Mentors -</b> <ul><li>Ayush Jain</li> <li>Gaganjeet Singh</li> <li>Shruti Choudhary</li> <li>Kanhaiya Bairwa</li> <li>Amisha Chajjlani</li></ul></li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Actors -</b> <ul><li>Karunesh Jigyasu</li> <li>Shreyansh Yadav</li> <li>Anuj Choudhary</li> <li>Saurav Pethe\r\n</li></ul></li>\r\n<li><b>Sounds -</b> <ul><li>Rohan Pillai</li> <li>Prajwal Aithal</li> <li>Akshay Dandekar</li> <li>Shrey Singh</li></ul></li></ul>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Karunesh speaks,</b>\r\n<br>\r\n"Sophie Prod has proved to be a journey to me - an odyssey full of experiences, moments that I will cherish forever, emotions - joy, frustration, excitement, anger. As if this whole experience was another mentor for me, teaching me valuable things. I am so overwhelmed with this whole experience that I am finding it difficult what should I share here - those endless spammings on our group, the daily nightouts we had, the moment when I came near to ditching the prod or the moment when I felt that our play will leave everyone mesmerized... there are so many emotions associated, so many memories!   Having chosen a patriotic script, I always had a side of me saying that we won''t do justice with the theme, and the expectations people seemed to have made it seem all the more negative. But my mentors really helped me a lot in this case. Knowing that I am such a nabdu, they always helped me keep my morale high... When I was on the LT stage, performing, seeing the audience reaction, I realised that maybe my play was a bit too heavy (or maybe it was being staged at the wrong time), but then just one glimpse of my mentors made me forget all the tensions creeping in my mind - the look that said, ''everything would be all right... we have full faith in you''. Ayush , Gagan, Shruti, Kanu, Amisha - Thank You! (But I know this isn''t enough) and sorry - if I ever made you give up! My teammates -Anuj, Pethe, Shreyansh, Shrey ... it was an awesome experience working with you guys!\r\n<br>\r\n''Meethe Kenchue'' is dedicated to you...won''t ever forget it...never!"\r\n</p>\r\n<p><b>Review by Arpit Agrawal -</b>\r\n<br>\r\nThe writer (Karunesh) has picked up an episode from history, a very known story especially after it was highlighted in Rang De Basanti, and given it his own little twist and spice if I might say. The interesting plot revolves around the bonding that two of our freedom fighters, Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqulla Khan, shared as they plotted India''s fight for freedom contrasted against the fictional story of their accidental friendship as children.\r\n<br>\r\nThe play presents 2 parallel stories. First is the one of a young Hindu boy, Ram (played by Anuj) though hostile towards Muslims, somehow through the game of "Kanche" finds a close friend in Ashu (played by Saurav), a young Muslim lad, new in the neighbourhood. Parallel runs the story of Ram Prasad Bismil (Shreyansh) and Ashfaqulla Khan (Karunesh) who each find their love for poetry along with their common passion for India''s freedom that drives them to new plans to save Indians from the atrocities of the British. The first few scenes do extremely well in establishing each of the characters - Ashu is shown to be really playful and at times mischievous while Ram and Ashfaq each bring out a very serious character from the very beginning.  As the story progresses, one begins to spot the similarities between Ram and Ram and also between Ashfaq and Ashu, and as the play draws to a close, it shows that Ram and Ashu are indeed the childhood of Ram and Ashfaq.\r\n<br>\r\nThe flow of the play and the characters displayed by the actors show that Karunesh has put in considerable effort in doing research on the characters and content of the play. Another noteworthy thing was how meticulously it was ensured that each dialogue of Ashfaq was in Urdu, and those of Bismil were in Hindi.\r\n<br>\r\nA special mention needs to be given to Shreyansh, whose brilliant body language, especially while narrating the poems, delivered an added impact to these patriotic poems.\r\n<br>\r\nA few points the play could have improved upon: the costumes of the actors who played the child roles seemed a little out of place, the lighting of the entire play was slightly on dimmer than expected as the actors'' face could often not been seen clearly and a little more effort needed to be put into stage design. But overall, a very brave attempt on the part of these sophies and one of the better plays of the night in my opinion.\r\n<br></p>\r\n<font size="4"><b><i><ins>Will learns to lie</ins></i></b></font><ul><li><b>\r\n\r\nScriptwriter -</b> <ul><li>Palash Kulkarni</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<b>Mentors -</b> <ul><li>Yudhister Satija</li><li>Arpan Saha</li><li>Raunak</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<b>Actors -</b> <ul><li>P V Krishna</li><li>Ishita Dasgupta</li><li>Shrey Agrawal</li><li>Palash Kulkarni</li><li>Abhishek Yadav</li><li>Aditya Gangrade</li><li>Devendra Chaplot</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<b>Sounds -</b> <ul><li>Namrata Singh</li></ul></li></ul>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Palash speaks,</b>\r\n<br>\r\n"It was already midnight. The play which I had nurtured for almost four months was about to be performed in front of some hundred odd people in LT. The feeling was new and vaguely unfamiliar. While I was disappointed that the play had gotten delayed by almost two hours, I was equally nervous and excited to see it unfold in front of my eyes.\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it began.\r\n<br>\r\nContrary to what I had expected, I wasn''t nervous or scared when it was all happening. Things were just ''flowing'' without any hidden machinery - falling into place, effortlessly. There was hardly any time to feel. The applause, the laughter, the crowd''s reaction made us feel alive. We messed the last scene of the play. Nevertheless the play happened as we had expected.\r\n<br>\r\nThe experience, to say the least, was enriching. Right from the days of scripting to the final curtains of the play, I felt a persisting sensation of being a part of something big. What I find almost unbelievable is that something which began with a single thought which struck me one fine evening grew into a half an hour extravaganza.\r\n<br>\r\nEn route, I met some wonderful people. The actors - Shrey, Abhishek, Aditya, Krishna, Ishita, Ashvin, Nilesh, Namrata and Devendra were always ready to go for that extra mile in rehearsing, the mentors - Yudhister (Yudi) who always kept us on toes, whose enthusiasm rubbed off onto us, Arpan whose inputs from last year''s experience were helpful, for lack of a better word, Ronak from whom we learnt a lot about theatre and acting in general. I would like to extend my gratitude to Prasun Agrawal who understood the play more than anyone, probably even more than me.\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, I would like to congratulate Shubham and Fourth Wall for organizing such a great show.

This is the story of three newspaper distributors(paper-waalas) who hang and distribute the news paper in the morning near a tea stall of a muslim old man. They talk about things printed on the news paper daily. One of them is really concerned about the things happening in and around the country but the other two just make fun out of it. The 3 had really good bonding among themselves and also with the tea vendor. The owner of the news paper agency is a very cruel and harsh man. One of the paper-waala''s has recently gotten married to a beautiful girl in the town.  But one day all of theirs lives changes when blasts happen in Mumbai and one of them dies in it. But the owner steps out of clause and asks them not panic and move on with their lives. The play very well describes how we ignore things around us and do not take measures to prevent and preserve things until something bad happens with us. And how the normal life continues to flow despite of the losses and devastations we experience in our lives.  A very versatile acting by Badri with his comic and funny style in the beginning and after the blast the panic and shock and also Jitendra very well pulled of the difficult role of old man in the story. The lights were the special mention of the play, the director very creatively showed early morning scene of around 4 am with a combination of dim normal lights and blue spots. Overall very well scripted (Jayant ), very well acted by the cast, very well directed play.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size="4"><b><i><ins>Jazbaat</ins></i></b></font><ul><li><b>\r\n\r\nScriptwriter -</b> <ul><li>Deepak Sharma</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<b>Mentors -</b> <ul><li>Altaf ahmad</li><li>Divya Alok Nirmal (Pappa)</li><li>Arpit Agrawal</li><li>Anant Tiwari (Baba)</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<b>Actors -</b> <ul><li>Deepak Sharma</li><li>Pankhuri</li><li>Manish Kumar Poddar</li><li>Rishabh Bajaj</li><li>Devansh Chawla</li><li>Diksha Meghwal</li><li>Pukhraj Kansotia</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<b>Lights -</b> <ul><li>Vinay Yadav</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<b>Sounds -</b> <ul><li>Shubham Yadav</li><li>Parul Verma</li><li>Akshay Dandekar</li><li>Rohan Pillai</li></ul></li></ul>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Review by Akhil Sharma -</b> \r\n<br>\r\nJazbaat as the name suggest was a play that revolves around the feelings of mentally retarted people. The story has a feel good factor since it was charmed with the innocence that the actors pulled off brilliantly. The lead actor and the actress showed some brilliant chemistry but the best aspect of the play was that every person standing on stage showed some briiliant acting skill which made it a complete play. It was a play that looked complete and reflected the hard work the bacchas and the mentors had done.The mentors especially a person like altaf ahmad needs no introduction and he displayed awesome dram sense, but again the collective effort of Pappa, baba and others made this play look so real. The acting, the music and the lights all were nearly perfect and so was the script.The play was succesfull when it comes to touching your heart since it was a perfect blend of innocence of love and the harsh reality that the protaganist faces.The only thing the play didnt incorporated was the crispness and the fluctuating emotions that had a wide scope for this play.\r\nThe initial scenes of the assylum created a ''deja vu'' and then the length was also a bit long.Although the amazing perfoemance of the sophies never let the distractions overcome their play. I would like to sum up the review with last statement that the play was heart touching and the bacchas brilliantly pulled off a serious play which will be remembered as one of the best sophie prod for years.Just remember that the actors were so perfect and the music was aptly timed that even the disruptive audience couldnt make a noise till the curtains had fallen, and the only sound I could hear was of a LOUD APPLAUSE.\r\n<br>Credits to the very dedicated team of sophies and mentors and hope to see you people again on stage.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<font size="4"><b><i><ins>Tamanna</ins></i></b></font><ul><li><b>\r\n\r\nScriptwriter -</b> <ul><li>Surabhi Srivastava</li></ul>\r\n<b>\r\nMentors -</b>  <ul><li>Tanash Sharma</li><li>Prasoon Agrawal</li></ul>\r\n<b>\r\nDirectors -</b> <ul><li>Surabhi Srivastava</li><li>Parul Maheshwari</li></ul>\r\n<b>\r\nActors -</b> <ul><li>Anvita Dekhane</li><li>Ekansh Bansal</li><li>Bhavna Saxena</li><li>Vivek Paharia</li><li>Pikai Sarkar</li><li>Shubhanshuk</li><li>Mayank Choudhary</li><li>Ram Babu</li><li>Kartik Kalra</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<b>Lights -</b> <ul><li>Parul Maheshwari</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<b>Sounds -</b> <ul><li>Abhijeet Somani\r\n</li></ul></li></ul>\r\n<p><b>Review by Rohan Sabley -</b><br>\r\n\r\n''Tamanna'' is the same old cliched female centric story that is common in many rural areas of India with a fresh perspective by a very talented writer/director.  It speaks of the transformation of a young girl form the rural interiors to the new empowered women by virtue of her education in the city who fights against the oppression (or rather the lack of free will to women ) of women in the society. It''s also a journey of self-discovery for the lead protagonist Tamanna (Played by Anvita). The plot has various flashback and real time scenes happening one after the other which is lucidly explained in the script.\r\n<br>\r\nSubhanshuk (Hawaldar) and Mayank(Inspector) do great in their parts. Subhanshu uses the rural accent to suit the plot and does commendable world in his sly humor and body language (talk about getting into the character). Bhavna (Tammanas mother) efficiently essays a typical Punjabi mother who is proud of her daughter''s success and wants to get rid of her responsibility by marrying her daughter. Vicky (played by Vivek) is show as a naive brother at the start (which seemed a little too childish) but transfers into a strong character when he realizes his sister is actually in love with a guy-Ashish (Ekansh) from her college.\r\n<br>\r\nPikai (Ashish''s father) and Ashish (both do due justice to their roles) patiently try to convince the girl family for the marriage and the scene convincingly portrays the disregard of Love marriages in the rural Indian Society. Eventually the couple does get married.\r\n<br>\r\nA better portrayal of a romantic husband would have worked wonders in the anniversary scene. The argument scene seemed to go out of hand a little bit. It could have been much better with clarity of dialogues.  Vivek And his associate decide it time to get even with Ashish and eventually kill Ashish.\r\n<br>\r\nThe gem of the story is Tammana who comes out as a strong independent woman trying to fight against the society for her love. She maintains her calm during the whole ordeal and speaks up against her Husband''s killers silencing them while standing up for the right. Anvita does complete justice to her role with sublime acting and is bound to do great in future with polishing from Fourth Wall.\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, The well written script and great direction from Surabhi along with insightful narration greatly adds value to the play. On the whole it was a great effort by the whole cast and Mentors (Prasun and Tanash ) and a great time for  the audience . Fourth Wall seems to have a gem in Surabhi with her overall effort in the play and I am confident that she is bound to achieve great success in direction/script writing in Fourth Wall. All the best to all the sophomores who put a great show and may your contribute hugely to the club and enrich it even further.\r\n<br>\r\nPS- Long live Four Wall :P\r\n</p><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size="4"><b><i><ins>Namkeen</ins></i></b></font><ul><li><b>\r\n\r\nMentors -</b> <ul><li>Mriganka</li><li>Richa</li></ul>\r\n<b>\r\nScriptwriter -</b> <ul><li>Richa</li></ul>\r\n<b>\r\nActors -</b> <ul><li>Mriganka</li><li>Arpita</li><li>Gulshan</li><li>Sulakshan</li><li>Saurabh</li><li>Ankit</li><li>Abhranil</li><li>Spandana</li><li>Sanju</li></ul>\r\n<b>\r\nLights -</b><ul><li>Saurabh</li><li>Sulekha</li><li>Swati</li><li>Shyama</li><li>Shilpa</li></ul></li></ul>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<font size="4"><b><i><ins>Tabaadla</ins></i></b></font><ul><li><b>\r\n\r\nMentors -</b> <ul><li>Sohom</li><li>Kunal</li></ul>\r\n<b>Scriptwriter -</b> <ul><li>Kunal</li></ul>\r\n<b>\r\nActors -</b> <ul><li>Kunal</li><li>Sohom</li><li>Sandeep</li><li>Shubha</li><li>Uddipta</li><li>Archit</li><li>Sachin</li></ul>\r\n<b>\r\nLights -</b> <ul><li>Saurabh </li><li>Sulekha</li><li>Swati</li><li>Shyama</li><li>Shilpa</li></ul>\r\n<b>\r\nSounds -</b> <ul><li>Jigar</li><li>Vaibhav</li></ul></li></ul>', '2011-09-05', 3),

I was among those few lucky enough people to see and appreciate the beauty and truthfulness of the play.<br><br>\r\n\r\n"We are what we forget", says a character pensively towards the end of Atul Kumar''s directed and refreshingly enjoyable and engaging play, The Blue Mug. The play stars <b>Munish Bhardwaj</b>, <b>Sheeba Chaddha</b>, <b>Rajat Kapoor</b>, <b>Vinay Pathak</b>, <b>Konkana Sen Sharma</b> and <b>Ranvir Shorey</b>. Through bilingual - Hindi and English - monologues the actors, playing themselves (except Sharma and Shorey), re-construct themselves from their earliest memories to the present day in a rich tapestry of stories that questions the very concept of memory and does it primarily on the strengths of the actors performances. Inspired by <b>Oliver Sacks''s</b> essay, <b>''The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat''</b>, actors in <b>The Blue Mug</b>, struggle to construct themselves on the basis of what they remember, bringing up all those moments, both significant and irrelevant, which they salvage from the abyss of forgetting. They present themselves as they are, trying to sift truth from the fiction of their pasts.\r\n<br><br>\r\nKapoor kicks off the reminiscing by describing family gatherings centered on the bhutta (corn on the cob) where no one would worry about the digestive consequences of the day after. Chaddha talks about the beach, where she would collect remnants of glass bottles that have been worn by the sea into beautiful round pieces of shimmering blue and green. Pathak recounts the numerous times he was taken to the circus and the one embarrassing incident where a clown laughed at him in his face. Bhardwaj recalls his years in an all-boys convent school and "<b>all the things that happen there</b>". As the monologues move closer to the present, the actors share increasingly personal vignettes, connecting pieces of the puzzle to provide a fuller picture of themselves. Well, but the man who stole the whole show was Shorey(the opinion being strictly personal). The Sharma-Shorey track strays from the abstract structure of the rest of the play. Their storyline is dominated by Shorey who clearly has the meatier chunk of the two and, with a perfected Punjabi twang, delivers an astounding performance. The highlights of this sequence are when Shorey describes his family history (how they got into the business of selling fish), and later when he meets his brother after twenty years. It''s hilarious and heartbreaking at the same time.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Blue Mug has no set to speak of - just large chalkboards hanging from the ceiling on which the actors scribble key signs from their upbringing - and no costume changes. The focus is, therefore, entirely on the acting and how well the actors string it all together. But the small things like the sound of hopping of Chaddha while Kapoor describes his father''s death and the pace at which it increases as the emotion of the situation deepens and four of the actors repeating same dialogue again and again with increasing anger and intensity are really remarkable.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIf you are wondering why it''s called The Blue Mug, there''s no specific reason other than that it is an element of one of the actor''s memories. It also means that the play could have literally been titled anything else, depending on how you would want to remember it. That, essentially, is the point.', '2011-08-15', 1),

All the four actors followed their own way of presenting a character to the audience at their best. Being a great singer <b>Prashant Damle</b> gave his voice for some of the compositions in the play.<br> In this play they tried to show many love stories some of them were traditional and some were modern. Contrary to a belief that the four letter word "LOVE" lasts for four days and the rest is just compromise, Char Diwas Premache explores the true meaning of "love" through a series of relationships starting from a misunderstood childhood romance, followed by the fact that sometimes even provocation and jealousy can help you win a suitor at the same time also revealing that generation and communication gaps are normally the reason for heartbreaks and fallouts and successfully concludes the fact that true love lasts forever. The music by <b>Ashok Patki</b> throughout the play made the play to reach the amazing heights of emotions, comedy and drama. Screenplay is superbly carried out. Without using too much of props the garden, house, beach, television, bedroom were amazingly created. There is very little use of lights. While enjoying the play you cannot afford to miss even a single dialogue as the script is completely funny with a great level of humour.<br> <b>Fresh Voices</b> of <b>Savita Prabhune</b> and <b>Vina Jamkar</b> made female characters more alive. Unlike the other comedy plays it successfully maintained the humour till the end. Every character in a play has his/her own style and you can differentiate between them very easily (again the credit goes to the Director and the actors).

(3, 'Tumhari Amrita', 'Ayush Jain', 'The play that has a starcast of Shabana Azmi and Farooq Sheikh,is always a must watch. Ever sinceI had read about the play, I was looking out for any performance happening in Mumbai. Luckily, I came across one at the <code>Tata Theatre, NCPA</code>.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYes, the tickets were slightly costly i.e. Rs. 320, which is more than our average budget of an IITian''s play watching allowance (which is not more than 80rs on a Tuesday Prithvi Show). But then, not every day you get a chance to watch Shabana Azmi and Farooque Shiekh perform, and that too on the prestigious stage of the Tata Theatre at NCPA.\r\n<br><br>\r\n''Tumhari Amrita'' is a play in Hindustani written by Javed Siddique and directed by Feroz Abbas Khan. It is an Indian context adaptation of A. R. Gurney''s hugely popular American play, Love Letters (1988) in Epistolary form (a form of play written as a series of documents like letters, diary entries or newspaper articles). It made its debut on the February 28, 1992 and has been performed more than 300 times in the past 19 years.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt is a love story told through the exchange of love letters spanning 35 years between two people from very different backgrounds. The story revolves around the two chief characters, Amrita Nigam (Shabana Azmi) and Zulfikar Haider (Farooq Sheikh), starting with Amrita''s eighth birthday party in the 1940, when she first wrote to the ten-year-old Zulfi.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe play has the simplest production and lights and sounds that I have seen in theatre. There were just two chairs and two tables in terms of prod. The actors remained seated all the time, did not memorize the script and just read out the letters kept on their writing desks throughout the performance. In terms of lights, there were just two overhead spots on the two actors and no background music at all.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe beauty of the play lies in the way the story unfolds through the letters. It spanned over a period of 35 years and the pains and joys that the characters go through from childhood to adulthood, are depicted utmost convincingly only by the emotions and modulations in the reading by the two accomplished actors. There must have been more than 50 letters that each of them read and the flow of the story was brilliant.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAmong the things I liked the most about the narrative, were the casual "Naye Saal ki Shubhkamanaaye" and "Happy Birthday" letters that came during the course of the story. The casual non-chalant use of these provided perfect pauses between the interactions through the letters. Although the play had a serious story and relationship budding through it, the humour through the some of the letters and specifically the description of the sketches made by Amrita Nigam (Shabana Azmi) kept the audience alive and smiling.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThere were times in between, possibly post interval, when the narrative started to get slightly lengthy but it was more than made up with the amazing end. The last letters by both the characters ended the play on a great high. Farooq Sheikh was really good especially his Hindustani diction, with the flavour of his typical Urdu accent. Although, it is tough to compare between actors of such stature, but Shabana Azmi stole the show for me. It must have been because her character gave her a lot of variety but her smile and the depiction of the wild streak in the painter, Amrita Nigam came out amazingly well through her portrayal.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLastly, I''d say it surely is a play worth watching for a completely different theatrical experience. It teaches you the power of a script. It shows that you don''t necessarily need awesome technical requirements to create an impactful play; you just need a story worth telling and the vision to tell it in a unique yet simple manner.', '2011-09-13', 1),

Vicky (played by Vivek) is show as a naive brother at the start (which seemed a little too childish) but transfers into a strong character when he realizes his sister is actually in love with a guy-Ashish (Ekansh) from her college.\r\n<br><br>\r\nPikai (Ashish''s father) and Ashish (both do due justice to their roles) patiently try to convince the girl family for the marriage and the scene convincingly portrays the disregard of Love marriages in the rural Indian Society. Eventually the couple does get married.\r\n<br><br>\r\nA better portrayal of a romantic husband would have worked wonders in the anniversary scene. The argument scene seemed to go out of hand a little bit. It could have been much better with clarity of dialogues.  Vivek And his associate decide it time to get even with Ashish and eventually kill Ashish.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe gem of the story is Tammana who comes out as a strong independent woman trying to fight against the society for her love. She maintains her calm during the whole ordeal and speaks up against her Husband''s killers silencing them while standing up for the right. Anvita does complete justice to her role with sublime acting and is bound to do great in future with polishing from Fourth Wall.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLastly, The well written script and great direction from Surabhi along with insightful narration greatly adds value to the play. On the whole it was a great effort by the whole cast and Mentors (Prasun and Tanash ) and a great time for  the audience . Fourth Wall seems to have a gem in Surabhi with her overall effort in the play and I am confident that she is bound to achieve great success in direction/script writing in Fourth Wall. All the best to all the sophomores who put a great show and may your contribute hugely to the club and enrich it even further.\r\n<br><br>\r\nPS- Long live Four Wall :P', '2011-09-13', 2),
(5, 'Jazbaat', 'Akhil Sharma', 'Jazbaat as the name suggest was a play that revolves around the feelings of mentally retarted people. The story has a feel good factor since it was charmed with the innocence that the actors pulled off brilliantly. The lead actor and the actress showed some brilliant chemistry but the best aspect of the play was that every person standing on stage showed some briiliant acting skill which made it a complete play. It was a play that looked complete and reflected the hard work the bacchas and the mentors had done.The mentors especially a person like altaf ahmad needs no introduction and he displayed awesome dram sense, but again the collective effort of Pappa, baba and others made this play look so real. The acting, the music and the lights all were nearly perfect and so was the script.The play was succesfull when it comes to touching your heart since it was a perfect blend of innocence of love and the harsh reality that the protaganist faces.The only thing the play didnt incorporated was the crispness and the fluctuating emotions that had a wide scope for this play.<br><br>\r\nThe initial scenes of the assylum created a deja-vu and then the length was also a bit long.Although the amazing perfoemance of the sophies never let the distractions overcome their play. I would like to sum up the review with last statement that the play was heart touching and the bacchas brilliantly pulled off a serious play which will be remembered as one of the best sophie prod for years.Just remember that the actors were so perfect and the music was aptly timed that even the disruptive audience couldnt make a noise till the curtains had fallen, and the only sound I could hear was of a LOUD APPLAUSE.\r\nCredits to the very dedicated team of sophies and mentors and hope to see you people again on stage.', '2011-09-13', 2),
(6, 'Ye Gumnaam Zindagi', 'Altaf Ahmad', 'The sole of the play is based on how we ignore the blasts happening in India until it all happens wid us. This is the story of three newspaper distributors(paper-waalas) who hang and distribute the news paper in the morning near a tea stall of a muslim old man. They talk about things printed on the news paper daily. One of them is really concerned about the things happening in and around the country but the other two just make fun out of it. The 3 had really good bonding among themselves and also with the tea vendor. The owner of the news paper agency is a very cruel and harsh man. One of the paper-waala''s has recently gotten married to a beautiful girl in the town.  But one day all of theirs lives changes when blasts happen in Mumbai and one of them dies in it. But the owner steps out of clause and asks them not panic and move on with their lives.<br><br> The play very well describes how we ignore things around us and do not take measures to prevent and preserve things until something bad happens with us. And how the normal life continues to flow despite of the losses and devastations we experience in our lives.  A very versatile acting by Badri with his comic and funny style in the beginning and after the blast the panic and shock and also Jitendra very well pulled of the difficult role of old man in the story. The lights were the special mention of the play, the director very creatively showed early morning scene of around 4 am with a combination of dim normal lights and blue spots. Overall very well scripted (Jayant ), very well acted by the cast, very well directed play.', '2011-09-13', 2),
(7, 'Meethe Kenchue', 'Arpit Agrawal', 'The writer (Karunesh) has picked up an episode from history, a very known story especially after it was highlighted in Rang De Basanti, and given it his own little twist and spice if I might say. The interesting plot revolves around the bonding that two of our freedom fighters, Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqulla Khan, shared as they plotted India''s fight for freedom contrasted against the fictional story of their accidental friendship as children.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe play presents 2 parallel stories. First is the one of a young Hindu boy, Ram (played by Anuj) though hostile towards Muslims, somehow through the game of "Kanche" finds a close friend in Ashu (played by Saurav), a young Muslim lad, new in the neighbourhood. Parallel runs the story of Ram Prasad Bismil (Shreyansh) and Ashfaqulla Khan (Karunesh) who each find their love for poetry along with their common passion for India''s freedom that drives them to new plans to save Indians from the atrocities of the British. The first few scenes do extremely well in establishing each of the characters - Ashu is shown to be really playful and at times mischievous while Ram and Ashfaq each bring out a very serious character from the very beginning.  As the story progresses, one begins to spot the similarities between Ram and Ram and also between Ashfaq and Ashu, and as the play draws to a close, it shows that Ram and Ashu are indeed the childhood of Ram and Ashfaq.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe flow of the play and the characters displayed by the actors show that Karunesh has put in considerable effort in doing research on the characters and content of the play. Another noteworthy thing was how meticulously it was ensured that each dialogue of Ashfaq was in Urdu, and those of Bismil were in Hindi.\r\n<br><br>\r\nA special mention needs to be given to Shreyansh, whose brilliant body language, especially while narrating the poems, delivered an added impact to these patriotic poems.\r\n<br><br>\r\nA few points the play could have improved upon: the costumes of the actors who played the child roles seemed a little out of place, the lighting of the entire play was slightly on dimmer than expected as the actors'' face could often not been seen clearly and a little more effort needed to be put into stage design. But overall, a very brave attempt on the part of these sophies and one of the better plays of the night in my opinion.', '2011-09-13', 2),

(9, 'The Last Verdict', 'Gaganjeet Singh', 'Based on a fight over a controversial case, this play had a very nice content. Informations to be given were nicely spread/scripted over the whole plot. Play had 2 lawyers against each other on a suicide which was very smartly framed. The story is quite simple though. A rich girl is kidnapped by some unknown kidnappers who later on force her father to commit suicide if he wants his daughter to be safe. Poor father without thinking or consulting someone else simply commits suicide (which was bit surprising for me). And there is a charge of murder on his business partner for kidnapping his daughter and forcing him to suicide because of company shares. Later on, it eventually comes that his daughter kidnapped herself with the help of her father''s business partner. And due to the lack of facts his business partner is set free by court. Charm of the play was the plot of the court-room. It was very nicely scripted and arguments from both the parts were quite strong. Having Bala on lights means you need not worry about it any more. Lights were good. Play used some nice and interesting background scores. Death and after death scenes were symbolically depicted by the evil of life, which was unique. All the actors were good. One of the lawyers'' kept fumbling with his lines, though carried out decently at the end. Play had a heavy prod. which was creating problems for the light set-up. The office of the father was made in the right quadrant of the stage to avoid unnecessary black outs. The play got nice appreciation from the audience. Overall a nice play to watch and good entertainment for the audience.', '2011-09-13', 2),

The colleague (who incidentally, also played the hilarious Rickshaw-wala) had what is called, an impeccable timing. Nobody could''ve even imagined what was in store in the climax of Some Times.

But put her before the mike and she at once acquires a striking persona. It''s all in her full-throated voice. It''s the voice with a cross-generational appeal. It''s the voice that comfortably traverses genres. It''s the voice that oozes sensuousness and emotion in the switch of a tune. So, you can hear a classical thumri or dadra, a hard-rocking "Ab ke saawan", the resonant "Ali more angana" or a moving "Pyar ke geet".\r\n</p><p>\r\nA post graduate in music and trained by several gurus, including Pandit Vinay Chandra Maudgalya, Pandit Jitendra Abhisheki and Pandit Kumar Gandharva, Shubha scaled the musical charts with her album "Ali More Angana" in 1996. "Though it was talked about a lot, it was certainly not my first album as many think. I had done enough classical work before (since 1986), which were well received. Anyway I didn''t get carried away by all the attention as the album was just an extension of my artistic endeavours."Her foray into the field of popular music was quite incidental. \r\nShubha has done extensive research in ancient and medieval music, particularly bhakti sahitya to know how it can guide and add depth to sangeet. "Because when I started learning I was told that music and devotion are synonymous. That''s why Indian music is meditative and soothing. This is one of the reasons why I took diksha into a Krishna sect. The importance they give to music is absolutely moving. They make two kinds of offerings to the Lord - bhog seva and raga seva. This tikka, which many see as a stylised bindi, is a symbol of belonging to this group," says this first generation musician, whose parents taught English at the Allahabad University.</p><p>\r\nThough her world revolves around melody, she is an avid sari collector and a foodie, who savours all kinds of vegetarian preparations.

No, it''s not an adaptation of Hamlet, Macbeth or Othello - Shakespeare''s most popular tragedies, which have been emulated countless times. Piya Behrupiya, it is the Hindi translation (not adaptation) of Bard''s famous comedy play, Twelfth Night. So we have the love-sick Duke Orsino (Sagar Deshmukh), who is hopelessly in love with Lady Olivia (Mansi Multani). He orders the cross-dresser Cesario, to plead with Olivia on his behalf. But Cesario is actually a woman in disguise, named Viola (Geetanjali Kulkarni) who is in love with the duke.

A nautanki musical that has many folk songs performed by the characters, the traditional musical score gives this 17th century Shakespearean drama a unique Indian flavour. Also, unlike adaptations, where the character names are changed to suit the backdrop of the play, Amitosh Nagpal, who has translated the play in Hindi, has stuck to original names.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the dialogues are run-of-the-mill, with a mix of Hindi and occasional English words thrown in for poetic and comical effect, what elevates the show are the various Indian accents by the characters and the way each artiste has performed a particular role.
